# Weapon-Detection-System

This project uses the Roboflow YOLOv5 Google Colab notebook which can be found in the Roboflow Model Zoo. 

The dataset was downloaded from Google's Open Image Dataset (https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/visualizer/index.html?set=train&type=detection&c=%2Fm%2F083kb) using 
the OIDv4 toolkit and consisted of around 1500 annoated images. These images were uploaded to Roboflow and were further pre-processed and augmented.
